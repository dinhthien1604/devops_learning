## 1. Open the IAM Service
- Go to **Services** > **Security, Identity, & Compliance** > **IAM**.

## 2. Create a New IAM User
1. Navigate to **Users** and click **Add users**.
2. Enter a user name (e.g., `devops_user`).
3. Select **Access key - Programmatic access** to allow API/CLI access.
4. Click **Next: Permissions**.

## 3. Assign Permissions to the User
1. Select **Attach existing policies directly**.
2. Choose a policy, e.g., **AdministratorAccess** (for full access) or more restrictive policies based on your needs.
3. Click **Next: Tags**, then **Next: Review**, and finally **Create user**.

## 4. Secure the IAM User
- Download the access key ID and secret access key securely. This will not be shown again.

## 5. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
1. Go to **Users**, select the created user, and open the **Security credentials** tab.
2. Click **Manage MFA** and choose **Virtual MFA device**.
3. Use an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator) to scan the QR code.
4. Enter the two consecutive MFA codes generated by the app.

## 6. Create IAM Roles (Optional but Recommended)
- Navigate to **Roles** and click **Create role**.
- Select a trusted entity (e.g., **AWS service**) and attach necessary policies.
- Use this role for services instead of directly using IAM user credentials.

## 7. Configure IAM Password Policy
1. Go to **Account settings** in the IAM dashboard.
2. Set a strong password policy (e.g., require at least 12 characters, numbers, symbols, uppercase, and lowercase letters).
3. Save the changes.

By following these steps, you ensure secure access and management of your AWS resources. Use IAM roles for better security and avoid sharing user credentials.
